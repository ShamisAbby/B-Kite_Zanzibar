                                Kiteboarding in Zanzibar has become a top world class destination.
                                The wind, the water, the weather makes an island an ideal place for
                                the complete beginners needing a stress-free experience, as well
                                as independent riders looking for untapped spot to session all day long.
                                You will be amazed by possibilities that an island got from the mother
                                nature: shallow lagoon, flat turquoise water and endless beaches with
                                smooth white sand make this island a kiteboarders paradise.
                                Barely 1.5km away from the shore you will find the reef where
                                waves can reach up to 3 meters height. Perfect treat for waves lovers.
